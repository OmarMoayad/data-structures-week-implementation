## ðŸ“¦ Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Dynamic Array

A dynamic array is a resizable array that automatically grows when full.

**Overall Time Complexity**:  
- Average: O(1) per operation (amortized)  
- Worst Case: O(n) during resize  

**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 2. Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a dynamic data structure where each element points to the next.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 3. Stack using Array

A stack is a LIFO structure implemented here with a dynamic array.

**Overall Time Complexity**:  
- Average: O(1)  
- Worst Case: O(n) during resize  

**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 4. Stack using Linked List

A stack implemented using a linked list for fast push/pop.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(1)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)
