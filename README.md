## ðŸ“¦ Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Dynamic Array

A dynamic array is a resizable array that automatically grows when full.

**Overall Time Complexity**:  
- Average: O(1) per operation (amortized)  
- Worst Case: O(n) during resize  

**Space Complexity**: O(n)

---

### 2. Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a dynamic data structure where each element points to the next.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 3. Stack using Array

A stack is a LIFO structure implemented here with a dynamic array.

**Overall Time Complexity**:  
- Average: O(1)  
- Worst Case: O(n) during resize  

**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 4. Stack using Linked List

A stack implemented using a linked list for fast push/pop.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(1)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

5. Queue using Linked List
A queue is a FIFO structure implemented using a singly linked list.

Overall Time Complexity:

Enqueue: O(1)

Dequeue: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(n)

6. Circular Linked List
A circular linked list where the last node points to the first, allowing continuous traversal.

Overall Time Complexity:

Insert at position: O(n)

Delete/search: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

7. Doubly Linked List
Each node has both next and prev pointers, allowing bidirectional traversal.

Overall Time Complexity:

Insert/delete front/back: O(1)

Find/remove by value: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

8. Queue using Array
A simple linear queue using an array with front/rear management.

Overall Time Complexity:

Space Complexity: O(n)
